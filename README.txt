DISCLAIMER:

This project was developed for a college assignment and will not be developed any further.
Bugs and the rest aren't gonna be fixed, so please don't hound me on those.
Wanna fix em yourself? Great! Fork the project and debug away!

A couple known bugs are listed below:

Enemies are rendered behind the background walls.
The falling animation doesn't trigger 100% of the time.
The health system is jank at best.
There's no menu/pause/exit button. (just alt+f4 lol)
The throw animation is super short. (thanks, spritesheets.)
